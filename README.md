## Java Concurrency
Currently I am doing examples from Java Concurrency section to revise some things<br>
 and to learn new ones.<br><br>

<i>The following topics were implemented in my examples:</i>
  1. Java Synchronized Blocks. (2 examples using one instance and two instances).
  2. Thread Local. (example with ThreadLocal variable).
  3. Thread Signaling. (2 examples with 4 different MyWaitNotify objects).
  4. Locks<br>
  4.1. Basic (example with 2 different Counter objects).<br>
  4.2. Reentrant (example with 2 different Reentrant objects).<br>
  5. Read / Write Locks in Java.<br>
  5.1. Basic<br>
  5.2. Reentrant<br>
  6. Semaphores.<br>
  6.1. Signaling (example with using semaphore for signaling).<br>
  6.2. Lock (example with using semaphore as lock). <br>
  7. Blocking Queues. (example of using blocking queue implementated by hand).
  8. Thread Pools. (example of using thread pool implemented by hand).
  9. Non-blocking Algorithms.<br>
  9.1. Volatile. (example of using "one writer and many readers" situation).<br>
  9.2. Compare and Swap. (example of using "many writers and many readers" situation).<br>
