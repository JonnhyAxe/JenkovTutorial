Here are practice examples from Jakob Jenkov's tutorial on http://tutorials.jenkov.com/

## Java Concurrency
Here are examples from Java Concurrency section to revise some things<br>
 and to learn new ones.<br><br>

<i>The following topics were implemented in my examples:</i>
  1. Java Synchronized Blocks. (2 examples using one instance and two instances).
  2. Thread Local. (example with ThreadLocal variable).
  3. Thread Signaling. (2 examples with 4 different MyWaitNotify objects).
  4. Locks<br>
  4.1. Basic (example with 2 different Counter objects).<br>
  4.2. Reentrant (example with 2 different Reentrant objects).<br>
  5. Read / Write Locks in Java.<br>
  5.1. Basic<br>
  5.2. Reentrant<br>
  6. Semaphores.<br>
  6.1. Signaling (example with using semaphore for signaling).<br>
  6.2. Lock (example with using semaphore as lock). <br>
  7. Blocking Queues. (example of using blocking queue implementated by hand).
  8. Thread Pools. (example of using thread pool implemented by hand).
  9. Non-blocking Algorithms.<br>
  9.1. Volatile. (example of using "one writer and many readers" situation).<br>
  9.2. Compare and Swap. (example of using "many writers and many readers" situation).<br><br><br>


## Java Concurrency Util
After revising inside of useful structures, I have started tutorial about java.util.concurrent package.<br><br>

<i>The following topics were currently implemented:</i>
  1. Blocking Queue interface (queues package)<br>
  1.2. ArrayBlockingQueue example<br>
  1.3. DelayQueue example<br>
  1.4. LinkedBlockingQueue example<br>
  1.5. PriorityBlockingQueue example<br>
  1.6. SynchronousQueue example<br>
  2. Blocking Deque interface (deque package).<br>
  2.1. LinkedBlockingDequeu example.<br>
  3. ConcurrentMap interface (maps package).<br>
  3.1. ConcurrentHashMap example.<br>
  3.2. ConcurrentNagivableMap example.<br>
  4. CountDownLatch example.
  5. CyclicBarrier example.
  6. Exchanger example.
  7. Semaphore. <br>
  7.1. Semaphore as a lock example. <br>
  7.2. Semaphore as a signaling mechanism example. <br>
  8. ExecutorService interface <br>
  8.1. Basic example. <br>
  8.2. ThreadPoolExecutor example. <br>
  8.3. ScheduledExecutorService example. <br>
  9. ForkAndJoin. <br>
  9.1. RecursiveAction example. <br>
  9.2. RecursiveTask example. <br>

<br>
From time to time, this section will be updated with examples...
